Robot: I'm cold.
Robot: Wait, where am I?
I look up to see a world with little colour.
A wasteland.
In front of me is a young girl with long brown hair.
Girl: It worked.
I look back down to see my arms.
They are made out of some sort of scrap metal.
Wait, who am I to begin with?
Robot: Where are we?
The girl just smiles, then walks away slowly.
I take a better look around.
I see numerous lights.
Orbs of light at that.
They float by with the motion of the wind.
The girl begins to walk back towards me.
As she approaches I notice tears running down her cheeks.
She bends down to be on the same eye level as me.
Only then do I realize how short my stature is.
She then leans in to give me a hug.
The warmth of her body begins to make me feel less cold.
As she holds me I look up and stare at the gloomy looking sun.
The sun begins to get brighter.
And brighter.
And brighter, until the entire sky becomes one big bright abyss.
I have to close my eyes to block out the light.
I then lose full sensation of my body.

NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Fantasy II
Tomoya: Whoa.
As I begin to open my eyes I notice that it's already morning.
I get out of bed.
As my feet hit the floor fragments of what I assume to be a dream start running through my memory.
I can't tell what was happening in this dream, but it just seemed very strange.
It's a monday so there's school.
However, as I look at my alarm clock I notice it started over an hour ago.
I quickly pack my things and head out the door.
I hate this town.
There's just too many memories here I'd rather forget.
Every day is the same.
Go to school, sit through boring lessons, come home, repeat it all over again.
Nothing new ever happens.
I wonder if anything will change if I keep living like this.
I wonder if my life will ever change.
I continue my journey to school.
As I walk I think about how my teachers will scold me for coming in late again.
That doesn't bother me anymore, I have become accustomed to it at this point.
But what hasn't become accustomed to me is walking up this long hill everyday.
I mean who even puts a school on such a big hill anyway.
I'll never get it.
Approaching the foot of the hill I see someone.
A girl.
Girl: Do you like this town?
Is she talking to me?
Tomoya: Uhh...
Tomoya: Not particularly.
Girl: Have you not heard?
...
Girl: The wishes this town grants.
Tomoya: Are you talking about those children stories?
Girl: They're not just stories.
Girl: People reuniting with long lost family members.
Girl: The amount of people who have beat incurable diseases.
Girl: And even those who have acquired great riches.
Tomoya: Who knows how true those stories really are.
Girl: well I believe in them.
...
Tomoya: So, what's your name anyway?
Girl: Nagisa, and yours?
Tomoya: I'm Tomoya.
Tomoya: Why are you out here anyway, school started over an hour ago.
Nagisa: School is a little bit scary.
Tomoya: I get it i'm not very fond of school myself.
Tomoya: would it help if we went together?
Nagisa: I think I can handle that.
And so we start our journey up that hill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tomoya: How come I've never seen you before, I mean we go to the same school after all.
Nagisa: I have missed a lot of school.
Nagisa: I am prone to getting sick very frequently.
Nagisa: And because of that I'm always behind on my work.
Nagisa: Which causes me to get nervous to go to school and see all the work I need to get done.
Tomoya: I see.
...
Tomoya: Well, were here.
Tomoya: See you later.
Nagisa: Bye.
That was quite a surprise.
I can't remember the last time I had a decent human interaction like that.
Almost made it worth coming to school today.

NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Nagisa ~ Farewell At the Foot of a Hill
Entering my math class I am met with my teacher lecturing me for being late.
As expected.
I take my seat and stare at the clock the entire period until lunch.
...
The bell rings and it's finally time for lunch.
I'm unsure if I should eat my lunch outside behind the school or if I should just head home.
-
I decide to head outside behind the school.
Just as I get outside I notice someone sitting next to a tree.
Nagisa.
Tomoya: Hey.
Nagisa: Oh, hi.
Tomoya: Mind if I join you?
Nagisa: Sure.
Tomoya: So, what brings you out here?
Nagisa: The cafeteria is way too loud to enjoy my lunch.
Tomoya: Ya, I'm the same way.
-
I decide to head home.
Just as I start to head down that hill I notice someone in front of me.
Nagisa.
Tomoya: Mind if I walk with you?
Nagisa: Sure.
We walk side by side.
Tomoya: Are you walking home?
Nagisa: Ya, it's because the cafeteria is way too loud to enjoy my lunch.
Tomoya: Same here.
-
...
Nagisa: Are you aware of the talent show next thursday?
Tomoya: ya why?
Nagisa: I'll be in it.
Nagisa: I play the clarinet.
Nagisa: It would be great if you could be there to watch me.
Nagisa: If you're not too busy that is.
Tomoya: Oh of course, I'll definitely be there then.
Nagisa: Great.
...
Tomoya: not to ruin the moment but I was just curious, how bad is your illness?
Nagisa: well, most of the time I'll be fine after a couple of days.
Nagisa: But occasionally I will have to spend a couple nights in the hospital.
Tomoya: oh, I'm sorry.
Nagisa: No it's fine don't worry about it.
-
We continue talking until the bell rings to signal the end of lunch.
Nagisa: See you later.
Tomoya: Ya, bye.
We then head back to our afternoon classes.
-
We continue talking until our different paths home separate us.
After lunch I head back to school for afternoon classes.

NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Nagisa
Man, what a day.
Today's lessons felt a lot harder than usual.
Especially in math.
I think my teacher was saying something about derivatives.
Whatever that means.
Why am I even trying to remember it's not like i'm gonna do the homework anyway.
As I leave the school I begin to reflect on my day.
Nagisa, there's just something particular about her.
She's seems isolated from the world.
First at the foot of the hill, then outside by herself.
I decide to stop thinking about it.
Later that night, after not doing much of anything I get into bed and begin to think again.
It was quite a nice surprise meeting her today.
Usually I spend my days in what seems to be a never ending loop.
But today wasn't like any other day.
I'm now looking forward to the possibilities that might make tomorrow another new day.
I close my eyes and go to sleep.
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: The Days' Leisure
Robot: I feel cold again.
I look up to once again see the same girl in front of me.
This time she looks a little more happy.
Robot: Where are we?
Once again the girl just smiles.
However, this time she says something.
Girl: I suppose you would like to get out of this place.
Girl: One day we will be able to go home.
Girl: But that day is not today.
...
I once again daze up at all of those lights floating through the sky.
Girl: Your probably wondering what all these lights are.
Girl: These lights are granted wishes from people on earth.
Girl: If a wish comes true then an orb of light will appear here.
The girl continues to talk, however my sense of hearing begins to fade away.
And with that so do my other senses.
...
Tomoya: Whoa.
I once again wake up from a weird dream.
This one tho, sticks out a bit more than the last.
I'm able to remember the events of this one better.
I remember there was a girl.
But I can't quite make out what she looked like.
As I continue to try and think of what she looked like, I notice school started almost an hour ago.
Yet another day of being scolded by my teachers.
I get dressed, grab my things and head out the door.
It's so hot today.
Approaching the foot of the hill I yet again see someone standing alone.
Nagisa.
Tomoya: Hey, good morning.
Nagisa: Good morning.
Tomoya: To scared to go to school again.
Nagisa: Ya.
Tomoya: Lets go together then.
Nagisa: Okay.
And so, this became a routine for the next week.
Eating together during lunch also became part of this routine.
Over the course of a week we became closer friends and would spend more time together.
Throughout these next few days I would start looking forward for the next day to begin.
Anticipating what new things could happen.
I start feeling as if my life is about to change for good.
Feeling that maybe this town wasn't such a curse.
Maybe this was the plan it had made for me.
I just had to wait it out.
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Summertime
It's tuesday night. 
Two days before Nagisa is supposed to preform in the talent show.
Shes been practicing hard all week to make this performance as good as possible.
Well, shes been telling me how hard she has been working.
She says she doesn't want anyone to hear her play until thursday.
I kind of wanted to hear her practice, but I think I can wait till thursday.
I look over at my alarm clock.
The time reads one a.m.
I didn't think it had gotten so late.
I get into bed and shut my eyes.
I attempt to go to sleep but the excitement I have for these next few days keeps me awake.
Eventually tho, I fall asleep.
...
Robot: Ahh.
Robot: It's so cold.
The girl appears in front of me yet again.
This time appearing happier than the last.
Robot: How do we leave from here?
Girl: These orbs will help us home.
Girl: But only one of them can bring us back.
Robot: Let's catch them then.
Girl: Once our orb is ready it will reveal its self to us.
Girl: If it's not ready it will not appear here.
Robot: Oh.
Robot: So when will this orb come to us.
The girl only smiles.
Looking at her, her figure begins to fade with the sun.
My senses start to go as well.
Everything is so bright.
...
I wake up.
Man, that has been the third weird dream i've had in the last week.
This one felt just as real as the last.
But I still couldn't think of what that girl looked like.
Today is wednesday. 
The day before the talent show.
I pack up my things and head out the door.
I meet Nagisa by the foot of the hill per usual.
Tomoya: Good morning.
Nagisa: Hey.
She seems a bit off today.
Tomoya: Are you alright?
Nagisa: I'm not feeling to well today.
Nagisa: But I think I will be alright.
Tomoya: Are you sure you will be alright, you seem very sick.
Nagisa: Ya, I go through this all the time.
Nagisa: However, this is the feeling I usually get before needing to go to the hospital.
Nagisa: Don't worry, it'll pass.
Tomoya: If you say so.
As we continue up the hill I can't help but notice how pale her skin looks.
As we approach the school we say our goodbyes and head to class.
Throughout the entire day all I can think about is Nagisa.
I know she said she was fine but she looked really bad.
During lunchtime I head out to where we usually meet up.
I sit and wait.
As each minute passes, I begin to get more and more worried.
Is she even at school anymore?
I hear the bell ring.
Is lunch already over?
I don't even want to get up from where I'm sitting.
I'm too scared at what the reality of this situation might be.
I get up tho.
But instead of heading to my afternoon class I run straight home.
I want to get away from this situation.
I want to pretend that everything is okay.
When I get home I go straight to my bed and push the pillow to my face.
I just lay there and completely clear my mind of all thoughts.
...
I fall asleep.
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Roaring Tides
Robot: It's so cold.
Something feels different.
As I look up I see an abundance of lights orbs.
Three times as much as last time.
They glide through the air much faster as well.
Girl: It's almost time.
Robot: Almost time for what?
Girl: For us to leave.
As she says this the orbs of light begin to spin in a circle over our heads.
They light up the world like stars on an empty night sky.
They get brighter.
And brighter.
And brighter, until the sky is completely filled with colour.
I then start to lose feeling in my body.
...
Tomoya: Whoa.
Yet another peculiar dream.
This one tho felt different from the others.
It felt as tho a big event was about to occur.
I yet again can't remember.
It's thursday, the day of the talent show.
Getting out of bed I recall the events that happened yesterday.
Right, the situation with Nagisa is still unknown.
Conveniently tho, school started an hour ago.
Which hopefully means Nagisa should be waiting for me by the foot of the hill.
I anxiously collect my things and head out the door, scared by what her not being there could mean.
I'm across the street from the hill.
If I look up I should see her.
Like any other day.
She should be standing there, waiting for me to look up and say good morning.
...
I look up.
...
No one's there.
I'm at a loss for words at what I should be thinking.
I feel a sense of emptiness.
Like a part of me has been taken away.
But maybe it's not that bad.
She did say she has gone through this many times before.
For now I try to convince myself that she will be alright.
But for now I'm not convinced.
During lunch I once again spend the whole time waiting for her to meet me at our usual spot.
She never shows up.
As lunch finishes I hear someone over the PA announce that the talent show will be starting soon.
Not that this matters to me anymore.
Not being able to hear her play is the least of my worries right now.
I don't want to head back to class.
I wanna find out what is happening with Nagisa.
I recall what she said the last time I saw her.
She said she felt similar to those times where she had to go to the hospital.
I don't even want to consider that possibility.
But now that I've thought of it, I know it won't escape my head until I see her again.
I can't think of another place I could possibly see her.
I don't know where she lives so this is the only place I could check.
So I start running.
The hospital isn't that far. 
If I run fast enough I should be able to get there in ten minutes.
I run faster than I have ever run before.
Not letting fatigue affect my speed.
I don't care how bad it hurts I just want to see Nagisa.
After several moments I reach the parking lot of the hospital.
Looking at the building makes this possibility feel much more real.
I head inside.
I immediately look for the front desk.
Once I find it I go to the nurse sitting there.
Tomoya: Hi, I'm here to visit Nagisa.
At this moment I'm just waiting for the nurse to look at me weirdly and tell me there's no patients by that name.
Instead she gives me a different look.
One that looks like she's holding back tears.
Nurse: She is currently being operated on, you can see her in a couple hours.
My heart sinks.
She leads me to a chair in front of the emergency room she is in.
I take a seat.
I'm unable to process the information that was just given to me.
It all feels fake.
I hold my head in my arms.
I close my eyes.
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: Snowfield
I feel something touching my shoulder.
It keeps tapping.
I look up to see the same nurse telling me I can see her now.
Before I'm allowed to go in she tells me something.
Nurse: She doesn't...
Nurse: She doesn't have much time left.
What.
But how could this be?
I nearly collapse.
But I compose myself.
I head into the room.
I grab Nagisa's hand.
Nagisa: Tomoya, I'm happy you've come.
Nagisa: I missed you.
Tomoya: I missed you too.
Her voice is very soft.
Nagisa: I guess I missed the talent show.
Nagisa: Hehe.
She coughs.
Tomoya: How did this even happen?
Tomoya: I don't understand, you were fine just a couple days ago.
Nagisa: I'm sorry for not telling you earlier.
Her voice begins to get even softer.
Nagisa: But this isn't the end.
Nagisa: We will meet again...
Her voice starts cutting out.
Nagisa: Someday...
Nagisa: But that day is not today.
...
No.
I fall backwards and hit my head on the floor.
I hate this town.
I thought for sure this was the end of my repetitive life.
I thought this town granted wishes.
Just like Nagisa had told me.
People reuniting with long lost family members.
The amount of people who have beat incurable diseases.
And even those who have acquired great riches.
Was it all a lie?
Why is this happening to me?
I just want to go back to the way things were.
Is that too much to ask?
I start to feel the injury from hitting my head off the floor.
My conscience starts to fade.
...
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: If I Realized in Time
Robot: I'm cold.
I look up.
I once again see all the orbs circling above our heads.
Girl: It's time.
Girl: The orb is ready.
Robot: So we can go home?
Girl: Yes.
Girl: But first you must collect the orb.
Robot: Why me?
She doesn't respond, just smiles.
Girl: You must complete the wish by finding the orb.
Girl: And in doing so will give us our light orb.
Robot: What wish?
Girl: Go quickly there isn't much time.
I feel my senses starting to go.
Girl: Find it.
Robot: Where would it be?
Girl: It could be anywhere.
Girl: Just don't stop searching.
I can no longer hear her. 
My hearing is totally gone.
I begin to lose full sensation of my body.
...
Tomoya: Whoa.
Wait why am I here?
As I try to remember what I was doing before this a dream starts playing in my head.
I can remember it.
I remember my scrap metal arms.
I remember the orbs of light.
I remember what that girl told me.
Although I still can't picture what she looks like.
I have to look for the orb.
I look over at my alarm clock.
It says it's wednesday.
The day before the talent show.
It also happens to be the middle of the day.
I first go to look at the foot of the hill.
Nothing there.
I go to our usual spot at school.
Nothing there.
I start searching all around town.
I look behind houses, grocery stores and go by the hospital again.
Nothing.
I spend all day searching.
But I find nothing.
It begins to get darker out.
I decide to look at our school one last time.
As I approach the front gates I see it.
The orb.
I reach out with my hand.
And grab it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I make my wish.
I immediately go home.
NEW MUSIC UNLOCKED: The Place Where Wishes Come True
The next day I visit Nagisa in the hospital at the same time I did last time.
I hold her hand. 
Nagisa: I'm glad you came.
Tomoya: Are you feeling better.
Nagisa: Well definetely better than before.
Nagisa: I wassant sure if I was gonna make it.
Nagisa: Sorry if that was a surprise to you.
Nagisa: I knew this was coming for a long time.
Nagisa: I didn't want to worry you.
Tomoya: It's alright I forgive you.
Tomoya: Nagisa I have a question to ask you.
Nagisa: Yes?
Tomoya: Would you...
Tomoya: Would you be with me forever?
Nagisa: Of course.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It might have taken a week but Nagisa is finally back to being healthy.
She hasn't been outside in a week, so she insists we sit outside together.
We exit the hospital.
Nagisa: Whoa is that grass over there, I forgot what grass looked like.
Nagisa: I'm tired.
Nagisa: I'm gonna go lay down by that slanted tree over there.
Tomoya: Wait then let's just go back inside if you're tired.
She lays down.
Tomoya: Are you sleeping?
Robot: It's hot.
I notice the world we are in now is full of colour.
The sky a beautiful rich shade of blue.
The orbs have returned to moving with the motion of the wind.
Girl: Congratulations on collecting the orb.
Robot: Is this home?
Girl: Not quite.
Girl: There is one last thing that needs to be done in order for us to return home.
Girl: Follow me.
The girl takes us far away.
We stop when we approach a tree standing in the middle of the grass standing alone.
A slanted tree.
The girl lays down right next to it.
Robot: Are you sleeping?
